### Instagram Scraper

Scrapes profile feed items as well as stories-every 24 hours, and saves them locally. 

The timeouts in `isr/feed.js` are set so as to prevent instagram warnings, or potential bans due to excessive repeated user action when downloading media.

Use `npm start` or `yarn run start` to run the story service.

Use `npm run feed` to run the feed service.
